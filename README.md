# Terminal README Creator

## Description
This project was developed to allow the user to create a README using only their VS Code Terminal and the fs, path, and inquirer user interfaces. By answering a series of prompts generated by inquirer, the user will be able to create a README that includes their project title, table of contents, description, installation instructions, usage instructions, choose from four licences used (MIT, Apache, GPL, or BSD), and enter in their GitHub username and email address.
